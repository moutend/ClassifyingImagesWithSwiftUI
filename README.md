# Classifying Images with SwiftUI

This sample project is implemented in SwiftUI based on the following project:

- [Classifying Images with Vision and Core ML - Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/model_integration_samples/classifying_images_with_vision_and_core_ml)

There are two changes in this project:

1. The image classification model used is MobileNetV2FP16.
2. The project structure has been simplified. The UI is implemented in ContentView.swift, and the logic is implemented in ImagePredictor.swift.
